# Dungeons and Diagrams

[Web link](https://dandd.therestinmotion.com/)

This is an original puzzle by [Zachtronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics)
from the game [Last Call BBS](https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/).
I dug it so I recreated it for fun.


## Features 

- Arbitrarily sized puzzles on the original scheme.
- Every generated puzzle has exactly one solution.
- Individual puzzles shareable by URL.
- Pleasing wall/floor marking in the style of the original.
- Infinite undo. 
- Static single-page site with all of the computing done in your browser.

## Non-features

- Bad graphic design.
- Couldn't figure out a good way to build it for touchscreens. Use a mouse.
- Rules can be opaque for first-timers.
